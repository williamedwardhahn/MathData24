        <h1>Rain Detector from Photographs</h1>
        <p>Welcome to my project webpage! This project is focused on creating a rain detector using computer vision techniques. By analyzing photographs, this tool can determine whether it is raining or not.</p>
        
        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>This rain detector is built using <code>Python</code> and various computer vision libraries. The goal of the project is to automatically detect rain in images, which can be useful in several real-world applications such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Improving weather prediction models by providing real-time data.</li>
            <li>Enhancing autonomous vehicle navigation by recognizing rainy conditions.</li>
            <li>Optimizing the performance of outdoor surveillance systems by detecting adverse weather conditions.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>The rain detector uses image processing techniques to analyze photographs and identify patterns typically associated with rain, such as streaks or blurry regions caused by raindrops. Here's a simplified workflow:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Preprocess the image to enhance features associated with rain.</li>
            <li>Apply machine learning models trained to recognize rain patterns.</li>
            <li>Classify the image as "rainy" or "not rainy."</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h2>Why a Rain Detector?</h2>
        <p>Detecting rain in photographs is not just a fun challengeâ€”it has significant practical value:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Weather Forecasting:</strong> Rain detectors can supplement traditional meteorological methods by providing additional data points, especially in regions where weather stations are sparse.</li>
            <li><strong>Autonomous Vehicles:</strong> Recognizing rainy conditions is critical for adjusting driving strategies, ensuring safety, and improving the reliability of autonomous systems.</li>
            <li><strong>Outdoor Surveillance:</strong> In security systems, detecting rain can trigger the system to adjust camera settings or notify operators, improving the overall quality of monitoring.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
        <p>This project leverages the following technologies:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>Python</code>: The core programming language used for data processing and analysis.</li>
            <li><code>OpenCV</code>: A powerful computer vision library used for image processing.</li>
            <li><code>TensorFlow</code> / <code>PyTorch</code>: Deep learning frameworks used to train the rain detection model.</li>
        </ul>
